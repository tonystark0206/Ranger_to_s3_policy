**AWS S3 Policy Generator from Ranger Export**

**Overview**

This Python script is a basic skeleton for generating AWS S3 policies from a Ranger export JSON file. It demonstrates the process of reading the JSON file, generating AWS S3 policies based on HDFS policies, writing the generated policies to a separate JSON file, and applying the policies to an AWS S3 bucket.

**Requirements**

Before using this script, ensure that you have:

Python 3.x installed
boto3 library for AWS SDK (can be installed via pip install boto3)
An AWS account with the appropriate permissions to modify S3 bucket policies
An exported Ranger JSON file

**Usage**

Prepare Ranger Export: Export your Ranger policies in JSON format and save the file locally. Make sure the JSON file follows a structure similar to the provided sample.

**Configure the Script:**

Replace "path-to-ranger-policy.json" with the actual path to your Ranger export JSON file.
Modify the generate_s3_policies function to match your JSON's structure if needed.

**Run the Script:**

Execute the script in your Python environment (e.g., via a terminal).
The script will generate AWS S3 policies, save them to a JSON file, and apply the policies to an AWS S3 bucket.

**Verify the Output:**

Check the generated AWS S3 policy file (output-policy.json).
Verify that the policies are applied to the specified S3 bucket.

**Customize for Specific Use Cases:**

This script is a starting point. Customize it based on your specific use cases, such as policy structure, naming conventions, and S3 bucket selection.
Important Notes
Ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured (e.g., through AWS CLI configuration or environment variables).
The provided code assumes a basic Ranger export JSON structure. Adjust the code to match the structure of your specific export.
